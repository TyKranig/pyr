[] - Seasonal based records
    - Already inserting the season into the database
[] - only grab the most recent games
    - speed up run times
[] - Captain based records
    - need to grab captains from seasonal draft sheets, manual process
[] - combine writes into one big write to avoid long runtimes
    - Google only allows 100 writes per 100 seconds, currently the script is at 500 writes total
    - leads to super long run times waiting for the write limit to reset
